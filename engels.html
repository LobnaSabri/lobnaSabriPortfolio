      <p>
        I am an enthusiastic person who likes to meet new people. In addition to my connections, I would like to expand my knowledge in the area of SAP. Learning new (programming) languages interests me and would like to do so in the future.

      <h2>Projects I have worked on during my studies:</h2>

      <li>Software Development Project I</li>
      <br />
      <ol>

        <p>
          In my first year, second semester, we had to make a game in java in groups.
          The game we had to make was Rummikub.
          In java we were allowed to use scenebuilder to make the user interface. 
        </p>
        <li>My input</li>
        <br />
        <p>
          In my group, we did not divide the tasks; we agreed step by step 
          who is willing or able to do what. Generally speaking, I helped with the analysis, which involves
          create a domain controller. Of the 4 members in the group, I was the one of the two who did the 
          coding the most. 
        </p>

        <li>My feedback</li>
        <br />
        <p>
          The assignment was clear and I had played the game before. 
          Coding interests me a lot so even though I did not have much knowledge, it was nice to have limited freedom for once. 
        </p>
      </ol>
      <li>Business Software Project</li>
      <br />
      <ol>
        <li>Discription</li>
        <br />
        <p>
          In the second year of my studies, I had to make a web application in group.
          We got a customer who had a vision and we started developing that vision using use cases, wireframes and mock-ups.
Once we were on the same page as the customer, we could start building the backend and frontend (Sapgui5) using SAP.
        </p>
        <li>My input</li>
        <br />
        <p>
          Just like last year, we did not divide all the tasks, we took the initiative ourselves step by step to work on the code. The only tasks that were divided were 
          creating the use cases, wireframes and mock-ups. Because SAP was new to all of us, we 
we were often stuck, but fortunately we had our teachers who were happy to help us
        </p>

        <li>My feedback</li>
        <br />
        <p>
          From this project, I learned that communication is very important, both with the client and within your group.
          What is also necessary is to always check the requirements of the customer so that you do not forget to implement anything.
        </p>
      </ol>
      <li>E-project</li>
      <br />
      <ol>
        <li>Discription</li>
        <br />
        <p>
          My senior year's project involved creating a website using Drupal. 
          The client was very clear about which functionalities needed to be available, the only thing left to do in terms of analysis was to 
          visualize those functionalities using wireframes and mock-ups. 
          Creating the website itself was done in Drupal, the only part where there was any programming was to make the web application unique with self-made add-ons.
          </p>
        <li>My input</li>
        <br />
        <p>
          As in previous years, each team member took the initiative to help wherever possible. In terms of analysis, the tasks were divided and each 
          team member made wireframes and mock-ups of some functionalities.
        </p>
        <li>My feedback</li>
        <br />
        <p>
          From this project, I learned that it is important to communicate with the customer about why a functionality could not be implemented 
          or why it was implemented differently.
        </p>
      </ol>
      <li>Internship</li>
      <br />
      <ol>
        <li>Discription</li>
        <br />
        <p>
          During the second semester of my third year of college, I completed an internship with the company Flexso. 
          My internship assignment involved creating a production planner app. 
          The assignment included everything I would like to do after my studies. I worked with SAPui5 and ABAP to create the app. 
          For analysis, I followed the word of my supervisors, but there was plenty of room for my opinion.
         </p>
        <li>My input</li>
        <br />
        <p>
          For the frontend I worked with SAPUI5 and for the backend I used ABAP. I was taught of both elements the year before, coincidentally also 
         from some colleagues from Flexso. For the analysis, I was free to give my opinion and input, and I was strongly listened to. 
          Together with the help of my colleagues, I was able to deliver a great app.
        </p>
        <li>My feedback</li>
        <br />
        <p>
          My internship assignment was a pleasant mix of programming and analysis. It is also exactly what I want to do after my studies. 
          The company and colleagues were inormally friendly and helpful. During my internship I learned how things apply on the work floor.
